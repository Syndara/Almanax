# Almanax

Almanax is a console app written in .net CORE that will eventually get turned into a Discord bot of sorts.

The program currently is very simple and primitive.  It will show current Almanax offering and bonus when you start it up.

From there it prompts you to enter items indefinitely.  If the program finds a matching weapon or piece of armor it will print the stats to you in the console window.

At some point I might add more to this, but for now that's it.
